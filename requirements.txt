The goal is to create a modular, interactive prototype where ERP and MES components seamlessly integrate named nextFactory [for exhibition]
I want to demo NextFactory as a integrated ERP and MES software

Tech stack:

python pyqt6 for GUI
python for ore backend and fundamentals
postgres for database [installed on my laptop, generate table details, sql commands and how to setup for Nextfactory details]

Phase 1: Foundation Setup
Start here to establish the app's core structure, ensuring roles, database, and basic UI are ready yo prevents rework later.
Steps:
- Set up the PostgreSQL database: Install Postgres[complete on machine], create db schema as required
- Initialize PyQt6 app: Create a main.py with QMainWindow, including a login dialog (QDialog) for roles (Admin, Manager, Operator, Guest, Analyst). Use SQLAlchemy to query roles and enable/disable UI elements based on permissions.
- Add global utilities: Implement threading for real-time simulations (e.g., QTimer for periodic DB polls) and a central dashboard tab for cross-module views.
- Seed mock data: Write a script to populate the DB with sample entries (e.g., fake inventory items, users)(should work only first time or should be seperate).
- Testing: verify login and basic navigation. Ensure offline portability for the exhibition.
- Rationale: This phase builds the skeleton, allowing modules to plug in easily.


Phase 2: Implement Recommended Modules 
Focus on these first to get a functional MVP. Develop ERP modules before MES for logical flow (e.g., ERP inputs feed MES). Group by category for efficiency.

1. ERP: Inventory Management

    Function: Tracks stock levels, updates quantities, and logs material usage, providing views for searching and editing items.
    Integration with Other Modules: Pulls data from Supply Chain Management for incoming materials; pushes updates to MES Real-Time Data Collection (e.g., via DB triggers) for production consumption; feeds Reporting and Analytics for stock trend charts.
    Options: Low-stock alert thresholds (configurable via UI slider, e.g., 10-50%); filter by category (dropdown for raw materials vs. finished goods); auto-sync toggle with MES.
    Development Notes: Use QTableView for displaying DB queries (SQLAlchemy model: InventoryItem with fields like item_name, quantity). Add buttons for updates; use signals to notify other modules on changes.

2. ERP: Supply Chain Management (Simplified)

    Function: Manages procurement orders, tracks suppliers, and simulates deliveries to ensure materials are available for production.
    Integration with Other Modules: Triggers Inventory Management updates on delivery; sends orders to MES Production Scheduling for task creation; contributes data to Reporting for supply efficiency metrics.
    Options: Supplier priority ranking (editable list); simulation delay for deliveries (timer setting, e.g., 5-30 seconds for demo effect); auto-order based on inventory thresholds.
    Development Notes: Build a QFormLayout for order creation; use SQLAlchemy for a ProcurementOrder model linked to Inventory. Integrate with PyQt's QTimer for mock delays.

3. ERP: Reporting and Analytics

    Function: Generates visualizations and reports on KPIs like inventory turnover or production efficiency, pulling aggregated data.
    Integration with Other Modules: Aggregates from all (e.g., combines MES Performance Analysis with ERP Inventory for holistic charts); exports data for Guest users in demos.
    Options: Chart type selector (bar/line/pie via dropdown); time filters (e.g., last 24 hours); export formats (PDF/CSV button).
    Development Notes: Use Matplotlib embedded in QGraphicsView for charts; query DB with Pandas for analysis. Make it a central tab accessible from other modules.


4. MES: Production Scheduling and Dispatching

    Function: Creates and assigns production tasks, prioritizing based on resources and deadlines, with status tracking.
    Integration with Other Modules: Receives inputs from ERP Supply Chain (e.g., new orders); updates Real-Time Data Collection for live monitoring; feeds Quality Management for checks during execution.
    Options: Priority levels (high/medium/low dropdown); calendar view toggle (daily/weekly); conflict alerts (pop-up notifications).
    Development Notes: Use QCalendarWidget for scheduling; SQLAlchemy model for Tasks with foreign keys to orders. Dispatch via buttons that signal updates to other views.

5. MES: Real-Time Data Collection

    Function: Simulates gathering data from "sensors" or manual inputs, displaying live feeds for production status.
    Integration with Other Modules: Updates Inventory Management on material use; triggers Quality Management alerts; provides raw data to Performance Analysis.
    Options: Refresh interval (slider, e.g., 1-10 seconds); data source toggle (manual vs. simulated); anomaly thresholds for notifications.
    Development Notes: Employ QTimer for polling DB inserts; display in a scrolling QListWidget. Use threading to avoid UI freezes.

6. MES: Quality Management (Simplified)

    Function: Logs checks during production, detects defects, and ensures compliance with basic metrics.
    Integration with Other Modules: Pulls tasks from Production Scheduling; updates Real-Time Data Collection with status; contributes to Reporting for quality trends.
    Options: Defect categories (customizable list); pass/fail thresholds (numeric input); audit log export.
    Development Notes: Create a QFormLayout for check entries; model with SQLAlchemy for QualityLog linked to tasks. Use signals for real-time alerts.

7. MES: Performance Analysis

    Function: Calculates metrics like OEE or throughput from production data, providing insights for optimization.
    Integration with Other Modules: Analyzes data from Real-Time Collection and Quality Management; syncs with ERP Reporting for combined views.
    Options: Metric selectors (multi-select list); benchmark comparisons (input fields); visual themes (color schemes for charts).
    Development Notes: Use Pandas for calculations on DB pulls; integrate Plotly charts in PyQt. Make it triggerable post-simulation.
    Phase Testing: Simulate end-to-end flows (e.g., ERP order to MES completion). Verify role-based access (e.g., Operators can't edit schedules).

Phase 3: Implement Optional Modules 


8. ERP: Sales and Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

    Function: Manages customer orders and relationships, tracking interactions and order history.
    Integration with Other Modules: Feeds orders to Supply Chain and Inventory; updates Reporting with sales KPIs.
    Options: Customer segmentation (tags); status notifications (email simulation toggle); sync with scheduling.
    Development Notes: Use QTabWidget for customer views; SQLAlchemy model for Customers linked to orders.

9. ERP: Asset Management

    Function: Tracks assets like machines, including utilization and depreciation.
    Integration with Other Modules: Links to MES Maintenance for schedules; updates Inventory for asset-related stock.
    Options: Asset categories (dropdown); maintenance reminders (timer-based); status color-coding.
    Development Notes: QTableView for lists; model with foreign keys to maintenance logs.


10. MES: Resource Allocation and Status

    Function: Assigns and monitors resources like machines or materials dynamically.
    Integration with Other Modules: Supports Production Scheduling; updates Real-Time Data Collection.
    Options: Resource types (custom list); auto-allocation toggle; status indicators (icons).
    Development Notes: Use QComboBox for allocations; thread for status polls.

11. MES: Product Tracking and Traceability

    Function: Logs product genealogy for audits and recalls.
    Integration with Other Modules: Builds on Quality Management; feeds Reporting for traceability reports.
    Options: Trace depth (levels); search filters; export buttons.
    Development Notes: Tree view with QTreeWidget; model for TraceLog.

12. MES: Maintenance Management

    Function: Schedules and tracks equipment maintenance to reduce downtime.
    Integration with Other Modules: Links to Asset Management and Performance Analysis.
    Options: Maintenance types (dropdown); priority escalations; calendar integrations.
    Development Notes: QCalendarWidget; signals for alerts.

13. MES: Labor Management

    Function: Assigns and tracks worker schedules and performance.
    Integration with Other Modules: Supports Resource Allocation; updates Reporting.
    Options: Skill-based assignments; shift templates; metrics tracking.
    Development Notes: Gantt-like view with custom widgets; model for Workers.

    Phase Testing: Add integration tests (e.g., optional modules enhancing recommended flows). Package with PyInstaller for exhibition readiness.

Phase 4: Polish, Testing, and Deployment (2-3 Days)

    Refine UI for engagement (e.g., add demo buttons like "Run Simulation").
    Full system testing: Role-based scenarios, error handling, performance on target hardware.
    Deployment: Bundle app, include DB backup script. Prepare exhibition scripts (e.g., 5-min demo walkthrough)


Generate the roles login credential and their access details.
